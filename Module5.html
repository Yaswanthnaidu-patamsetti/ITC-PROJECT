        <h2><u>LINEAR BLOCK CODING:</u></h2>
        Linear block code is a type of error-correcting code in which the actual information bits are linearly combined with the parity check bits so as to generate a linear codeword that is transmitted through the channel
                <h3>Procedure</h3>
              <p>Now, in order to perform encoding, the datawords are encoded as codewords having n number of bits. We have recently discussed that a block has k bits and after encoding there will be n bits in each block (of course, n>k) and these n bits will be transmitted across the channel. While the additional n-k bits are not the message bits as these are named as parity bits but during transmission, the parity bits act as they are a part of message bits</p>

        <h2><u>SYNDROME IN LINEAR BLOCK CODING:</u></h2>
                   <h3>Procedure:</h3>
            <p>For a linear block code, the syndrome S is equal to the sum of those rows of HT where errors have occurred. The syndrome of a received vector is zero if R is a valid codeword. If errors occur, then the syndrome S is non-zero.</p>
