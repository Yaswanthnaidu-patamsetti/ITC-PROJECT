        <h2><u>LZW Dictionary CODING:</u></h2>
        The LZW algorithm is a popular compression method. This method is commonly used in GIF, with PDF and TIFF as options. Among several things, the 'compress' command in Unix. It is lossless, which means that no information is lost during compression. The technique is simple to develop and has the potential for extremely fast throughput when implemented in hardware. It is the GIF picture format's algorithm, which itself is based on the widely known Unix file compression programÂ compress.
                <h3>Procedure</h3>
              <p>1.LZW compression uses a code table, with 4096 as a common choice for the number of table entries. Codes 0-255 in the code table are always assigned to represent single bytes from the input file.</p>
                <p>2.When encoding begins the code table contains only the first 256 entries, with the remainder of the table being blanks. Compression is achieved by using codes 256 through 4095 to represent sequences of bytes.</p>
                <p>3.As the encoding continues, LZW identifies repeated sequences in the data and adds them to the code table.</p>
                <p>4.Decoding is achieved by taking each code from the compressed file and translating it through the code table to find what character or characters it represents.</p>

        <h2><u>HAMMING CODE:</u></h2>
        <p>
            Hamming code is a set of error-correction code s that can be used to detect and correct bit errors that can occur when computer data is moved or stored</p>
            <h3>Procedure:</h3>
            <p>1.Calculation of the number of redundant bits.</p>
<p>2.Positioning the redundant bits.</p>
<p>3.Calculating the values of each redundant bit.</p>
